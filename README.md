This week, I created a create a program that generates a kinematic chain (like a snake) made of jointed links (a jointed, motorized, innervated, sensorized); The chain's properties were as follows:

random number of, randomly shaped links with random sensor placement along the chain.
Links with and without sensors should be colored green and blue, respectively.

I introduced randomness into the program by utilizing the random() library, which generated a random number of sensor and motor neurons each time the simulation ran. 

In order to see the randomized simulations, download the code and run the search.py file, once you have pyrosim and pybullet installed.
